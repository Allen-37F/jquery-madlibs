So, I'm Michael Herman. I'm a Python and Frontend mentor here at Thinkful. I've been a back-end developer in Ruby and Python for about three years. I wrote a Python course for learning web development called Real Python.

As I said, I'm a new mentor at thinkful. In my opinion, when you are learning, finding a mentor is one of the most important tasks. Just having someone there to talk to, who struggled in many of the same ways makes a huge difference. Without the mentor I had, I wouldn't be here today. This is exactly what makes Thinkful special, and why I am a part of it.

So that's who I am. I'd love to know who you are. So, let's just go around quickly. Just saw your name, how much experience you have with programming, and where you're from. Oh and also indicate whether you know what madlibs is as that's what we will be creating today. Just a simple yes or no will suffice. 

...

Alright, so today we will be creating a madlibs game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Let me go ahead and pull up the final project so you can see what you'll be creating.

I've broken this into about four parts. Each part adds a new piece of functionality. I also have a blog post setup that goes over exactly how to do this. It's on Github right now, but I can send out the final link after the session if you'd like. Also, if you have a question, please enter it into the chat. I'll try to grab as many as I can. Or you can save your question to the end as we will have a more formal Q&A session. I'll also leave my email address so you can contact me directly.

Alright let's get started ...

Any questions?

Thanks so much. I hope this was helpful. My email is michael@realpython.com. Feel free to contact me about anything. Well, anything programming related. Thanks!
