The people who have been coming have had a range of backgrounds. A lot of them really wanted to know if they needed a mentor and what they should do next -- so leave time for questions!



So, I'm Michael Herman. I'm a new mentor here at Thinkful. Besides being a just awesome, I've been a back-end developer in Ruby and Python for about three years. I wrote a Python course for learning web development called Real Python. There's actually a KickStarter for the third course, which goes over advanced web development, which went live last night. Feel free to pledge and shout it from the mountain top.

As I said, I'm a new mentor a thinkful. In my opinion, when you are learning, finding a mentor is one of the most important tasks. Just having someone there to talk to, who struggled in many of the same ways makes a huge difference. Without the mentor I had, I wouldn't be here today. This is exactly what makes Thinkful special, and why I am a part of it.

So that's who I am. I'd love to know who you are. If you feel up to to it, could you enter your name, where you're from, and your favorite programming language. Oh and also indicate whether you know what mad libs is as that's what we will be creating today. Just a simple yes or no will suffice. Thanks!

Today, we will be creating a mad libs game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Let me go ahead and pull up the final project so you can see what you'll be creating.

I've broken this into about four parts. Each part adds a new piece of functionality. I also have a blog post setup that goes over exactly how to do this. It's on Github right now, but I will send out the final link after the session. Also, for time's sake, please try to save your questions until the end. I'll also leave my email address so you can contact me directly.

Alright let's get started ...


Any questions?

Thanks so much. I hope this was helpful. My email is michael@realpython.com. Feel free to contact me about anything. Well, anything programming related.
